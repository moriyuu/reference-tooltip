    <h1>La La Land</h1>
    <p>
      La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical film written and directed
      by Damien Chazelle. It stars
      <referenced-word rwid="ryan_gosling">Ryan Gosling</referenced-word> as a
      jazz pianist and
      <referenced-word rwid="emma_stone">Emma Stone</referenced-word> as an
      aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love in
      <referenced-word rwid="los_angeles">Los Angeles</referenced-word> while
      pursuing their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first
      conceptualised the film alongside Justin Hurwitz while attending Harvard
      University together. Moving to
      <referenced-word rwid="los_angeles">Los Angeles</referenced-word> in 2010,
      Chazelle wrote the screenplay but did not find a studio willing to finance
      the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his
      2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment.
      Filming took place in
      <referenced-word rwid="los_angeles">Los Angeles</referenced-word> from
      August to September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz and
      the dance choreography by Mandy Moore. La La Land premiered at the 73rd
      Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released in
      the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide
      against a production budget of $30 million.
