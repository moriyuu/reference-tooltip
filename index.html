      La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical film written and directed
      by Damien Chazelle. It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist and Emma Stone
      as an aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love in
      <referenced-word rwid="la">Los Angeles</referenced-word> while pursuing
      their dreams. Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer,
      Chazelle first conceptualised the film alongside Justin Hurwitz while
      attending Harvard University together. Moving to Los Angeles in 2010,
      Chazelle wrote the screenplay but did not find a studio willing to finance
      the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his
      2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment.
      Filming took place in Los Angeles from August to September 2015, with the
      film's score composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by Mandy
      Moore. La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival
      on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9,
      2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30
      million.
